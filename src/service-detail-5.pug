                p Shorter tooling lead times to deliver high efficiency molding units.  

            
            .section
                p Rapid tooling is a rapid prototyping technique that is largely used in the place of conventional tooling to produce functional molds for lower costs and shorter lead times. This method of manufacturing combines rapid prototyping techniques with digital tenacity of electronic CAD data files to produce a mold instead of a part. Molds produced with rapid tooling services can then be used in any molding process to manufacture multiple copies of a part.

                    h2 Advantages of Rapid Tooling 

                p Rapid tooling holds many advantages over the conventional tooling process. Some of the most important merits of employing rapid tooling includes: 
               
                h4.title •	Shorter lead times
                p Reduce the normal time for tooling from weeks to days. 
                h4.title •	Low cost 
                p Offers a cost-effective approach for creation of complex geometry molds that would not be attainable with conventional tooling . 
                h4.title •	Direct production from CAD data files
                p Ensure higher accuracy with direct production from digital CAD data files. 
                h4.title •	Automation 
                p Produce an endless array of tools with automated processes that require little or no human interaction from start to finish. 
                h4.title •	Error-free
                p By building the tool from the direct master pattern, human error that could arise in conventional tooling is greatly avoided. 


                h4.title •	Speed 
                p One swift operation that cuts away time-consuming techniques to deliver high-quality molds in appreciable time frame. 
                h4.title •	Design possibilities
                p Innovate with freedom and without restriction to bring complex shapes and pattern to live with digital capabilities integrated into the rapid tooling process.
