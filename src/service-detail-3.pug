                p Urethane casting is a molding technique that uses silicone molds and urethane to form high-quality production-grade parts. The process is also known as cast urethane, silicone molding or RTV molding. Urethane casting is an excellent production technique that can help deliver production parts without the high overheads associated with traditional manufacturing with a speedier turnaround 
                
                h4.title •	Low-volume manufacturing, production-grade quality 
                p At Premium Part, our cast urethane service is fast, affordable and suitable for production of 20-100 units at production quality grades. Our capacity has been designed such that each silicone mold is capable of delivering 20 castings without compromising quality on even the smallest demand quantities. 

                h4.title •	Complex elastomeric parts and geometry
                p Our urethane castings are ideal for prototyping and producing complex parts with varying rigidity and elastomeric memory even under high temperatures, pressure and tensile strength. 

                h4.title •	Flawless detailing and precision manufacturing 
                p Bring even the most complex designs to life and smash the limits of CNC machining with cast urethane parts that detail design to perfection. Produce cast urethane parts with unimaginable complexity beyond the capacity of injection molding.

                p Choose between multiple material types to find the best-fit solution for your production parts

                

                h4.title •	ABS-grade 
                p ABS-like material that can be used for a general-purpose urethane casting. This material grade is similar to the ABS thermoplastic and excellent for hardware inserts and enclosures. ABS-grade materials boast of excellent impact and chemical resistance, excellent low and high temperature performance, structural strength and ease of finish application.

                h4.title •	Acrylic-like 
                p These materials are transparent, stiff and similar to PMMA acrylic. They serve for the production of parts that require some element of see-though such as light pipes, safety screens, automotive rear-light clustering, baths, dental fittings and more. Acrylic-like urethane cast materials have outstanding surface hardness, may be scratch-proof and has unlimited colouring and finishing potential. 

                h4.title •	Elastomers or PU rubber
                p We also offer elastomer materials that are similar and rubber-like. These elastomers may resemble TPU, TPE rubber-like and silicone rubber materials that are great for wearables, overmolds, gaskets and more. They have excellent abrasion resistance and insulating properties and their versatility allows them to be tailored for some of the most demanding markets and industrial sectors.

                p Choose amongst a wide array of finishes and treatment options after production of your urethane casting parts. Premium Parts provides standard colour and finishes that involves the addition of pigment to the urethane before casting or the use of pantone code colour swatches for precise colour matches. We also deliver custom finishes that allows you to customize the texture by painting the mold before production or by texture-painting the finished parts.
