                h1 Die Casting Services
                p High fidelity production parts for medium and high-volume manufacturing.

            
            .section
                p Pressure die casting service involves injection of molten metal into a mold cavity or steel die to produce strong, functional and trustworthy parts of your design. The process is similar to injection molding, and is a guaranteed method of producing average to substantial volumes of metal parts. Premium Part employs the use of state-of-the-art machines and high-quality pressure casting dies to produce parts with excellent surface finish, tight tolerances and inch-perfect dimensional precision. 
                p With varied and extensive experience in die casting, our process is dynamic, effective and cost-optimal. Choose from zinc, aluminium, magnesium to accommodate your material, end-use and volume needs.

                p Our pressure die casting process basically consists of 7 steps. Die cast parts are manufactured in steel molds similar to the ones used in injection molding under high pressure and cooled to set into the shape of the casting. Our premium die casting manufacturing process can be summarized as follows: 
      
                h4.title •	Clamping 
                p Here, the dies are cleaned and lubricated. The die halves are then closed and clamped under high pressure. 

                h4.title •	Injection 
                p During the injection phase, the molten metal is injected and forced into the clamped die under extremely high pressure. The molten metal is kept in the die until it solidifies. 

                h4.title •	Cooling
                p The molten metal which is now in the die is then cooled. This process is important to allow the solidification of the metal. The cooled metal fully forms the part and takes the shape of the casting. 

                h4.title •	Ejection 
                p Once the metal has cooled, the ejection process begins. Here, the die halves are unclamped and the solidified part is pushed out of the die. 

                h4.title •	Trimming 
                p This process is a pre-finishing process that ensures the removal of excess metals in the sprue and runner along with any splash or metal debris. These extra materials are removed from the final die-casted product to ensure cleanliness, dimensional and physical accuracy.

                h4.title •	Recycling
                p At Premium part, we strive to optimize material utility. After trimming of extra material from the runner and sprue, we reprocess these materials for the next set of die-casting process to ensure higher product yield from material input. 

                h4.title •	Finishing service
                p After completing the die-casting process, we offer high quality finishing services ranging from polishing, plating, painting, sandblasting and powder coating.
