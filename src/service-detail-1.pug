                p CNC machining is a computer numerical control machining. It is a subtractive manufacturing procedure where a variety of tools directed by a computer is used to systemically remove raw materials till a final product or production part is made. CNC machining processes specialized digital design models to manufacture high-quality prototypes, tool molds and production arts. CNC machining can   also be employed in pressure die casting or plastic injection molding services. CNC machining takes a number of forms, and CNC milling and turning are two of the more common CNC techniques in the industry.

                p CNC milling is essentially a process where a machine command is deployed by the computer for to designate specific drilling and turning along axes to cut the material into the pre-set specifications and dimensions. 
                p At Premium Parts, we offer both 3/4/5-axis CNC machining capabilities. Our machine milling services are specialized for a wide array of processes including the fabrication of complex 3D shapes, machining production-grade prototypes or applying machined surface finishes. CNC milling machining processes can also produce ball joints, rollers, spindles, brackets, valve bodies and many more.
