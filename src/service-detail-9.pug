                h4.title •	Painting 
                p Painting may be considered basic, but remains one of the best way to deliver visual appeal. At Premium part, we offer high quality spray painting over a wide array of colours, palettes and finishes. With only the finest materials, we provide custom paint options that will remain uniform across all your parts with the highest quality standards and certifications. Choose between matte to semi-glossy, flat or glossy, satin, smooth or textured finishes and be rest assured of a professional paint job that will crown your product.

                h4.title •	High-gloss polishing 
                p Get that shiny mirror-like appearance by polishing your metal with a moderately-rough sandpaper for a high-decorative finish. We use a systemic process that enables us to have the perfect finish using different grains of diamond paste. 

                h4.title •	Anodizing 
                p Anodizing your parts will not only deliver visual effects, it helps to improve corrosion resistance, reduce wear and tear, promote heat dissipation and improve surface hardness. Our anodizing process is excellent for painting and priming and may be used in conjunction with dyes and tints to deliver a variety of visual aesthetics that make your parts look and feel premium. Anodizing is more popular in electronics and is one of the most popular methods that smartphone giant Apple uses in over 80 percent of her products. 

                h4.title •	Blasting 
                p This process involves the use of an abrasive media sprayed with utmost accuracy and control to clean and deburr your part. Blasting is excellent for imprinting unique and custom textures and can be done with a wide array of media.

                h4.title •	Logo and inscriptions 
                p Mark your custom printing and etch your desired finish on your product. Premium part offers a variety of ways to etch and engrave logos, inscriptions, trademarks and more on your part without ruining the surface appearance while achieving precision and permanent markings that will never fade off. 

                h4.title •	Electrophoresis  
                p This is the application of a special paint film that allows for a hard, adhesive and corrosion-resistant surface. At premium part, we offer electrophoresis to deliver many desired effects ranging from surface protection, discolouration resistance, anti-corrosion performance and much more. 

                h4.title •	Tinting  
                p Add character to your ABS, PMMA, PC or PS parts by applying the perfect shade of tint. Tinting is excellent for colouring plastic prototypes such as tail lights and turn signals.
