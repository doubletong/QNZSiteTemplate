                p Plastic Injection Molding has seen diverse patronage across a wide array of industries. The versatility of the process helps to produce large volumes of production-grade plastic parts ready to serve Industrial, commercial and private uses. 
                p Injection molding basically involves the infusion of molten resin into a metal die cavity under high pressure. The resin is then rapidly cooled to lower the temperature and aid the formation of a solid shape that fits the shape of the die.
                p The process may range from seconds to days or even weeks depending on the material, part size and design complexity
